Implement a simple guessing game.

The rules for playing are:

1.The program picks a random number from 1 up to 100.
2.The player guesses a number.
3.Depending on the guess, the program responds with one of three possible choices: (i)
The guess was too high. (ii) The guess was too low. (iii) The guess was correct. 
2. and 3. repeats until the guess is correct.
4.The program presents how many guesses were used, thereafter the program terminates.
Extra challenge: Ask the user before the game program finishes if the user like to play again. Y(es)/N(o). If the answer is Y, let the game start over. To make that happen you need another (outer) loop in your program.

Python3:
import random
guess_count = 0
random_int = random.randint(1,100)

for guess in range(random_int):
    guess = int(input("Enter an random guessed number"))
    guess_count += 1
    
    if guess > random_int:
        print("The guess was too high")
    elif guess < random_int:
        print("The guess was too low")
    else:
        print("The guess was correct")
        break
print("The number of guesses used:", guess_count)
