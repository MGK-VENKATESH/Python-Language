The Pythagorasâ€™ Theorem for a right-angle triangle can be written as a2 + b2 = c2, where a
and b are sides of the right angle and c is the hypotenuse. Write a function to compute the
hypotenuse given sides a and b of the triangle. The result shall be returned as a number.
Hint: You can use math.sqrt(num) or the ** operator to compute the square root of num.

 
PYTHON3:
import math

a = int(input("Enter the value of a:"))
b = int(input("Enter the value of b:"))


c = math.sqrt((a**2)+(b**2))


print("The result is:", c)
