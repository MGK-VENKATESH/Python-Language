The transpose of a matrix AT is obtained if you flip the matrix over its diagonal, that is it you switch the row and column indices of the matrix by producing another matrix . 

Example with 3 Ã— 2 matrix:

              

Write a function transpose(matrix) that returns the transpose of a 2D matrix as a nested list.
Run example:

>>> A = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
>>> transpose(A)
[[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]]
>>> transpose([[1, 2]])
[[1], [2]]
>>> transpose([[3]])
[[3]]
 
Python3:
def transpose(matrix):
    if not matrix:
        return []
    transposed = [list(row) for row in zip(*matrix)]
    return transposed
a = [[1,2,3], [3,4,5]]
print(transpose(a))
