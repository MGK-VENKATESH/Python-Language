Construct a function  distribute(my_item, my_list) that takes an element and a list of lists as arguments. The function shall return a new list that has a duplicate from the list content sent into to the function, where the value  my_item is inserted as an element in each sublist. The original list must not change. See example of a run below.

>>> old_list = [[’kangar’], [’z’], [’f’]]
>>> distribute(’oo’, old_list)
[[’kangar’, ’oo’], [’z’, ’oo’], [’f’, ’oo’]]
>>> old_list
[[’kangar’], [’z’], [’f’]]

Python3:
def distribute(my_item, my_list):
   new = [sublist+ [my_item] for sublist in my_list]
   return new
old_list = [['kangar'], ['z'], ['f']]
print(distribute('oo', old_list))
